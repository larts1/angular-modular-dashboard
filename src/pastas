BoB Ross sargeant rage:
What the fuck did you just fucking say about my paintings, you little bitch? I'll tell you hwat, I ranked master sergeant in the USAF, and I've been involved in numerous art demonstrations across the country, and I have over 30,000 confirmed paintings. I am trained in wet-on-wet oil technique and I'm the top devil beater on the entire PBS television network station. You're nothing to me but just anouther bush cleaning. You think you can get away with saying that shit about me after I kick the bucket? Think again, mudmixer. If only you could have known what agony city your "unhappy" little comment was about to bring you to, maybe you'd had held your fucking brush. But I tell you hwat, you couldn't, you didn't and now you're painting the price, you goddamn paintsniffer. I will SHIT Van Dyke Brown all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo. Happy painting and God bless.
